    <p2>JavaScript</p2>
        <p1> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. (Google:Wikipedia)</p1>
    <p2>Operators</p2>
        <p1> Javascript Operators. JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. (Google: Tutorials Teacher; <link href src ="https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/javascript-operators">)</p1>
    <p2>Variables</p2>
        <p1> A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers) (Google:Javatpoint <link href src="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&authuser=0&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS852&ei=iPH2XLDVOcqYr7wP98ugsAg&q=what+is+javascript+variable&oq=what+is+javascript+variable&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l2j0i22i30l8.92695.94203..94616...1.0..0.97.667.11......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j33i160.0DwXlh42beQ">)</p1>
    <p2>Variable naming conventions</p2>
        <p1> Variable names cannot contain spaces. Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($). Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs. (GOogle: Dummies.com <link href src=></p1>
    <p2>Functions</p2>
        <p1>A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p1>
    <p2>Methods</p2>
        <p1>Actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition</p1>
    <p2>Arguments</p2>
        <p1>JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).</p1>
    <p2>Parameters</p2>
        <p1>The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations.</p1>
    <p2>Return</p2>
        <p1>In JavaScript, return statements cease execution in a function and return a value to the caller; JavaScript functions require an explicit return statement for returning the result of an expression (the value) from a function. When a return statement is not present, the interpreter automatically returns undefined.</p1>
    <p2>Chaining methods</p2>
        <p1>Method chaining is a technique that can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions on the same object consecutively. This is an example of how you can use method chaining when using jQuery</p1>
    <p2>Strings</p2>
        <p1>The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods. As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.</p1>
    <p2>Booleans</p2>
        <p1>Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false. In JavaScript, boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions etc. in terms of true or false. Example of boolean values: Here a1 and a2 stores the boolean value i.e. true and false respectively.</p1>
    <p2>Undefined</p2>
        <p1>a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such as: var TestVar; alert(TestVar); //shows undefined alert(typeof TestVar); //shows undefined. null is an assignment value.</p1>
    <p2>NaN</p2>
        <p1>"Not-a-Number" value. This property indicates that a value is not a legal number. The NaN property is the same as the Number.Nan property. Tip: Use the isNaN() global function to check if a value is a NaN value.</p1>
    <p2>Escape</p2>
        <p1>An escape character enables you to output characters you wouldn't normally be able to, usually because the browser will interpret it differently to what you intended. In JavaScript, the backslash ( \ ) is an escape character.</p1>
    <p2>Alert</p2>
        <p1>A JavaScript alert is a simple window containing a message</p1>
    <p2>Comments</p2>
        <p1>meaningful way to deliver message. It is used to add information about the code, warnings or  suggestions so that end user can easily interpret the code. The JavaScript comment is ignored by the JavaScript engine i.e. embedded in the browser.</p1>
    <p2>JQuery</p2>
        <p1>JQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. As you can see all JQuery is, is JavaScript.</p1>
    <p2>Attributes</p2>
        <p1>elem.hasAttribute(name) – checks for existence. elem.getAttribute(name) – gets the value. elem.setAttribute(name, value) – sets the value. elem.removeAttribute(name) – removes the attribute.</p1>
